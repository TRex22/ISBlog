title: I am Struggling...

##I am not sure what to do :-/
:cold_sweat:

This has been the most stressed I have ever been from any of my studies. I have to pass mathematics, and I seem to constantly be behind in course work and work in general.
I am not sure what to do. Is IS really needed for me to graduate? I can't keep pulling all nighters. I might just be in burn-out and perhaps should sleep and re-evaluate stuff some other time.

Maybe I am just reacting to all the stress, but passing just INFO will be a calamity. It would be useless, I would not be able to continue with my course without maths and I really want to finally complete CAM.

CAM is the jewel in my course. Computer science is a means to an end. There has not been anything truly interesting so far in coms but CAM has changed the way that I am able to solve problems. It is the maths used in the really cool side of programming, it will help me get to where I want to eventually go.
I dunno I am just stuck at the moment. Tired and slightly confused. I do not want to flail anymore.
:confused::worried:

Well tomorrow is a new day. I'll keep fighting.
