title: Some Updates

I have had exams which have been what has kept me away from doing projects and stuff.

The Blog
========
I have been trying to find the simplest solution to get this blog up and running. I believe this is probably it.
There is still quite a bit of work to be done to get this blog to a point where I can use it.

I would like to build a small mono app to make this blogging a bit neater and more professional - in terms of word processing

Some sort of rss feed and other notifications for when I make a new post would also be cool. Maybe Twitter?

A comments section would also be nice but would require a server backend or third party web service of some sort.
Facebook/Twitter integration could be used.

My website
==========
I really want to do some cool things there to showcase what I can create as well as have a domain to blog from.
The biggest problem is actually getting down to do it.

Some Projects
=============
I am working until Feb but I will have more time to work on private projects than I have had.
I want to continue RapidGame and make it something cool.
I have to finish my Wits Map App project before I continue with my web library, encyption stuff and website server thing.

I have some cool ideas I want to play around with. I also want to pick up Ruby and Rails as it seems like a cool direction to go in.
