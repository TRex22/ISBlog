title: Completed the initial tests and first group meeting for ms 2
---
I have completed the coding portion of IS2A, and the first test.
It seems that I am doing ok in IS and have not had any trouble so far - except the group project and my group members.

We had our first group meeting today. It went okay. We decided that we have to go for a consultation at least once. There are a few days that we have found that may be good to go.
A certain portion of the work must just be completed by that date before we can go to a consultation.
