title: Things are Done.
---

I have managed to complete the IS C# block 1 project. It went ok, I did go over the time I allocated to the project. The personal work for IS2A has gone quite well. I can work in teams as I have successfully done so in industry and also in other courses. The problem is that I don't know anyone in the IS class. Having a team of random people together may not work out. The massive difference in specific skills and skill-levels creates massive strain on some group members which is unfair.
I do have certain obsessions with submitting high quality work and not just looking over bad English or things not done right.
