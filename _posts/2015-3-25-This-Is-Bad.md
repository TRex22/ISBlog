title: This is BAD
---
My team sort of screwed me. I ended up with the most work. They stopped communicating and I eventually just gave up.
I should have done that earlier but whatever. Things are going to change. IS is really not important to me - without maths next year I will be happier at a better tertiary education institution.

Whatever I DONT CARE ANYMORE.
