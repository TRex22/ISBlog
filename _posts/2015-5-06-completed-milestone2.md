title: Completed milestone 2
---
I was the project manager for milestone 2 but similar problems occurred as with previous milestones. I refused to rewrite the majority of the work.
There were also commitment issues with team members and unexpected events. A team member had family issues to deal with and I personally fell behind on all my work.

I am disappointed with what we submitted and also tired since it eneded up with me staying up all night converting the diagrams into Visio. I know they are wrong and incomplete but I was too tired to care.
