title: So Much CAM work
---
For the next two days I have to work on CAM. I have an assignment due which will be my class mark for differential equations and I have a numerics test on Wednesday. There is a lot of stress to get all this work done and pass everything. I may have to not go to some lectures for the next couple of days. We'll see what happens.
